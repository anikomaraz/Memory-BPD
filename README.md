# Memory-and-BPD
This is a scientific project on memory functions in borderline personality disorder. We were interested in which factors influence emotional recall immediately after seeing the stimulus and 2-4-6 days thereafter.

Following a data collection of MTurkers, 3 papers were created. 

Paper 1 analyses data from the baseline data collection. We are interested in which factors influence emotional memory formation in people who are high on the borderline personality disorder trait.
